Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Yiyun (E-uwing) and I am a lab manager at the [Canine Cognition Center at Yale](http://doglab.yale.edu). i graduated from University of Rochester with a B.S in Brain & Cognitive Sciences as well as a B.A in Mathematics in 2018. I am an aspiring cognitive scientist interested broadly in the evolution of behavior and cognition. Over the past four years, I have conducted research with a variety of non-human primates in different settings (lab, zoo, and field populations) as well as pet dogs in the greater New Haven area. 

My research to date has investigated two lines of questions: Are non-linguistic minds capable of logical reasoning mechanisms and what kinds of social-cognitive biases and tools are unique to humans? For the former line of question, I conducted my senior honors thesis research with olive baboons at the Seneca Park Zoo and investigated whether they can reason through the disjunctive syllogism (the logic of "A or B, not A, therefore B"). For the latter one, I have conducted research with pet dogs on topics ranging from biases in social learning, to formation of social categories, to social desicion making in dogs. 

Outside of research, I serve as an alumni admissions interviewer for the University of Rochester and have interviewed over 100 prospective students over the past 3 years. I do photography on the side and love capturing different moments for people. As in international student who's navigated life in the US for the past 8 years, I occasionaly serve as a consultant for younger Chinese students who are in the process of applying to schools in the US. I love eating good food, traveling, and hiking.
